       <h2>Sachin Tendulkar</h2>
       <section>
           <p>Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, 
               and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. </p>
               <p>His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, 
                   economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots 
                   (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.</p>
