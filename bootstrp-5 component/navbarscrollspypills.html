            <h2>About Sachin's Personal Life</h2>
            <p>
                ou’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport,
                but you’ve heard the chant. The chant - one that a billion people o
                nce lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and
                echo across the city and the seas. It is a name that continues
                to inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world,
                to take up the sport. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any
                cricketing contest; yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India,
                the 5’5” giant of a man was much more than that. He was an emotion;
                a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.

            <h2>About Sachin's Family</h2>
            <p>
                In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a significantly transitional period for
                cricket, commercially and otherwise, and in a sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric
                conversation attracts, it is sometimes easy to forget that he was perhaps the most complete batsman of
                his generation - one who
                combined natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who
                recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the diamond.
                This uncommon blend of dedication and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the legend
                that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.

                Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion
                of popularity that cricket enjoys in India which led to the Indian
                board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket.
                In a country already predisposed to cricket, Tendulkar gave the people a hero they could look upto
                regardless of age, colour, creed or sect - and catapulted cricket from a sport to a religion in the
                subcontinent.

            <h2>About Sachin's Cricket Career</h2>
            <p>
                In a game riddled with statistics, he owns almost every batting record worth owning, including that of
                the most runs in Test and ODI cricket, the most hundreds in the two formats, and the highest number of
                centuries in international cricket - a mind-numbing 100. Despite a tough start to his ODI career,
                Tendulkar found his calling at the top of the order when he was sent to open against New Zealand in 1994
                and struck a 49-ball 82, and made the opening spot his own. He went on to compile 49 ODI hundreds by the
                end of his career -
                eclipsing the second-best by nineteen hundreds.
